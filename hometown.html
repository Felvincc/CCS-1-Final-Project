            <p class="body">
                Dumaguete City, also known as the “city of gentle people” is the capital of Negros Oriental. The city was formerly known as “Dagit” and “Dumaguet” because Moro pirates used to frequently raid the coastal city. The city is best known for Silliman University, established in 1901. The city is home to approximately 130,000 people. 
                <BR><BR>Dumaguete also coined the name “Dumaguet” because of its ability to attract tourists and foreigners and keep them here because of the beauty and location of the city. Dumaguete is part of Region VII of the Philippines near Cebu, Bohol and Siquijor. 
                <BR><BR>Dumaguete is a relatively small city with a land area of 3,362 hectares (8,310 acres), situated on the plains of the southeastern coast of the large island of Negros, near the mouth of the Banica River.

            <p class="body">Silliman University, our beloved alma mater, was established in 1901 by American Presbyterian missionaries. Silliman University holds the distinction of being the first Protestant and American-founded university in Asia. Originally founded as an industrial school for boys, it evolved into a leading institution of higher learning that integrates faith, knowledge, and service. The university’s Silliman Hall, constructed in 1903, is one of the oldest surviving American colonial buildings in the Philippines, showcasing a distinct architectural blend of Western and Filipino influences. Situated along Dumaguete’s seafront, the university’s expansive and verdant campus has long served as a center of education, culture, and public discourse, shaping the intellectual life of the city and the region.</p>

            <p class="body">The <q><i>Campanario de Dumaguete</i></q>, more commonly known as the Dumaguete Bell Tower, stands as one of the oldest surviving structures in Negros Oriental. Erected in the 1760s under the direction of the Spanish friars of the Augustinian Recollect order, the tower was originally built as a watchtower to defend the town from Moro pirate raids. Over time, it was fitted with bells to summon the faithful to worship at the adjacent Cathedral of St. Catherine of Alexandria, the patron saint of Dumaguete. The Campanario remains a symbol of faith, resilience, and historical continuity, bearing silent witness to centuries of religious devotion and community life in Dumaguete City.</p>

            <p class="body">Named in honor of the Philippine national hero Dr. José Rizal, Rizal Boulevard is one of Dumaguete City’s most iconic landmarks and a central feature of its urban heritage. Constructed during the American colonial period, the boulevard served both as a seaside promenade and a social gathering place for residents and visitors alike. Historical accounts suggest that Dr. Rizal briefly set foot in Dumaguete in 1896, and the boulevard was later named to commemorate his visit. Today, the area preserves its early 20th-century charm, with its Spanish-era lampposts, seaside views, and enduring cultural significance. It continues to symbolize the city’s historical connection to the broader narrative of the Philippine nation.</p>
